This project aims to create a matrix computing program that runs in the terminal. The key features are:

Wide variety of operations

Addition
Subtraction
Multiplication
Scalar Multiplication
Exponentiation
Determinant
Transposition
Inverse
Adjoint
*Program will also automatically detect matrix compatibility when performing certain operations.

User can choose to input matrix through terminal/command line or from an input.txt and input.csv file with a user-specifiable delimiter.

Answer is automatically output in the output.txt file with proper matrix brackets and also generates LaTeX code for the user. The program also outputs answers in the output.csv file as a comma-separated value.

Answer is automatically stored in Matrix Answer so that it can be used to compute or perform further operations later on.

User can view each stored matrix value
